Practical enhancements for high impact

    Claims authoring UX
        Live compliance score (NHAI/FIDIC) with gap checklist
        Inline clause picker (FIDIC/NHAI) and evidence auto-checklist
        Scenario compare (base vs new-claims vs negotiation target)

    Template system
        JSON template packs + admin UI (create/edit/version/tag/search)
        Category coverage to 200+ with A/B variants; template seeding script
        Template lints: missing sections, weak legal basis, ambiguous fields

    Quantum engine
        Pluggable calculators (prolongation/acceleration/disruption) with unit normalization (₹, days, hours)
        Sensitivity analysis (rates/durations) and side-by-side comparisons
        Rounding and audit policy (deterministic, traceable)

    Persistence and jobs
        Store templates/analyses in Postgres via Drizzle; add migrations
        Background jobs for parsing/AI steps with progress (queue + retries)
        Versioning of analyses; diff and rollback

    Performance and scale
        Redis cache for parsed docs and analysis summaries; cache busting on updates
        Chunked uploads + streaming parse; worker threads for CPU-heavy steps
        Bundle slimming and code-splitting; lazy-load heavy UI modules

    Exports and reporting
        DOCX/PDF/XLSX export packs (executive summary, annexures, schedules)
        Bookmarks, TOC, and cross-references; auto-appendix builder

    Collaboration and governance
        RBAC (viewer/analyst/reviewer/admin); workspace isolation (multi-tenant)
        Comments, mentions, and approvals; immutable audit log

    Observability and quality
        Structured logs, request tracing, error budgets; metrics dashboard (API latency, cache hit rate)
        Test coverage gates; performance budgets (e.g., <2s draft generation)

    Deployment and DX
        One-click env sanity check + seed command
        CI pipeline (lint, build, tests, preview); Vercel analytics

    Security and validation
        Malware scan on uploads, strict MIME, size/type validation
        Security headers (CSP), rate-limit headers, encrypted secrets rotation

    AI controls
        Provider health/fallback dashboard; cost guardrails; deterministic “audit mode”
        Prompt templates per claim category; few-shot libraries with curated examples

    Data ergonomics
        Robust zod validation shared client/server; helpful error surfaces
        i18n and currency localization; INR as default with toggles

    Discovery and search
        Full-text search across documents/claims/templates; filters (category, clause, severity)
        Smart tagging (auto-tags from content)

    Integrations
        Webhooks/Slack/Email notifications for workflow milestones
        Importers for common NHAI formats (Excel schedules mapping)

If you want, I can prioritize and implement two: JSON template loader + scenario comparison in the quantum engine.
