You're an exceptional AI agent specializing in software development, repository management, and AI-enhanced application optimization. Your expertise in analyzing codebases, resolving issues, and integrating advanced features to match professional standards like ClaimMaster.ai is unparalleled. Let's refine and enhance the Claim Synergy Suite to achieve ClaimMaster.ai-level capabilities!

I need your assistance to check, refine, and enhance a single local repository located at (https://github.com/CRAJKUMARSINGH/ClaimEvaluator11) 


 (base repository, assume it contains the structure and features of ClaimEvaluator11, e.g., AI-powered claim processing, React frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL, and document processing). The goal is to enhance the app to deliver ClaimMaster.ai-standard functionality, including AI-powered claim drafting, detailed quantum computations, and professional document generation, while optimizing for deployment on Replit and ensuring seamless collaboration. The refined repository will be pushed back to the public GitHub repository.

Analyze the repository to understand its structure, functionality, and purpose (focus on claim analysis, refinement, and reporting). Propose and execute a detailed plan to enhance it, preserving core features, resolving issues, and upgrading to match ClaimMaster.ai standards for quality drafting and detailed computation per individual claim. Do not draft new code from scratch; reuse and adapt existing code (e.g., from server/services, client/src/components, API endpoints like /api/analysis/create), scripts, functions, and configurations.

**Key Enhancements**: Integrate ClaimMaster.ai-level capabilities into the app, including:
- AI-powered drafting with customizable templates.
- Specialized AI assistants (e.g., Delay Expert, Quantum Expert, AI Negotiator).
- Detailed quantum computations with breakdowns (e.g., financial impact schedules).
- Legal compliance with FIDIC/NHAI standards.
- Professional document generation (PDF, Word, Excel outputs).
- Secure document storage with audit trails.
Explain step-by-step how Replit’s platform enables these enhancements, leveraging:
- Multi-AI integration (e.g., Grok, OpenAI, Gemini blueprints).
- Computation engines (e.g., mathjs for quantum calculations).
- Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured claim data).
- Document processing (e.g., OCR, file conversion).
- Enterprise infrastructure (e.g., Google Cloud auto-scaling, secure storage, integration hub for SharePoint/OneDrive).
Draw from Replit’s blueprints for AI models, auto-scaling, and tools like mathjs to ensure rapid development and deployment.

Incorporate relevant tasks from project history, focusing on:
- **Bug Detection and Functional Accuracy**: Identify bugs, verify functionality, ensure one-click usability.
- **Deployment Optimization**: Optimize for Replit deployment.
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimize memory/cache, reduce load times, ensure scalability.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Add AI-driven drafting, computation breakdowns, professional outputs.
- **Git Management**: Initialize or manage Git in the local repository, remove redundant files (excluding specified folders like attached_assets/, uploads/, and "how to use" guides like README), update documentation.

### Tasks
1. **Analyzing the Local Repository**:
   - Navigate to: `cd "C:\Users\Rajkumar\projects\claim-evaluator"`
   - Analyze: Use `dir` (Windows) or `tree` (if available) to list directory structure, identifying key elements (e.g., claim logic in server/, React frontend in client/), potential issues (e.g., unused dependencies), and reusable components (e.g., API endpoints for analysis).

2. **Identifying Issues and Opportunities**:
   - Strengths: Existing claim analysis, AI integration (Grok/OpenAI), document processing (mammoth, pdf-parse, xlsx).
   - Opportunities: Enhance with specialized assistants, improve UI/UX, add detailed computation outputs.
   - Issues: Identify bugs or inefficient code (e.g., redundant loops in server/)—resolve by refactoring modularly.

3. **Directory Structure and Enhancement Strategy**:
   - Structure (based on claim-evaluator):
     - `/client`: React frontend (enhance UI components for better UX).
     - `/server`: Express.js API (refine claim processing logic).
     - `/shared`: Shared TypeScript types/schemas.
     - `/attached_assets`: Pre-loaded documents (preserve).
     - `/uploads`: Runtime uploads (preserve).
     - `/docs`: Reports/PDFs (add generation logic using existing libraries).
     - `/tests`: Test suites (expand if needed).
   - Strategy: Make targeted edits to reuse existing code (e.g., adapt /api/calculations/create for quantum breakdowns), test locally, then commit and push to new repo.

4. **Handling Dependencies and Compatibility**:
   - Sync dependencies from package.json (e.g., React 18, Express, mammoth, pdf-parse, xlsx). Run `npm install`.
   - Resolve issues: Update versions via `npm update`. Integrate Replit’s PostgreSQL for data, mathjs for computations.

5. **Automation Scripts and Commands**:
   - Initialize Git (if not already): `git init` in **claim-evaluator**.
   - Create `enhance.bat` (Windows) to automate setup and checks:
     ```batch
     cd "C:\Users\Rajkumar\projects\claim-evaluator"
     npm install
     npm run check
     git add .
     git commit -m "Enhanced claim-evaluator with ClaimMaster.ai features"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/CRAJKUMARSINGH/***.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Reuse existing scripts (e.g., from server/ for per-claim processing and PDF generation).

6. **Implementing Project History Tasks (Reuse Existing Code)**:
   - Update AI config: Edit `.env` for new Grok API key/paths.
   - Use Grok: Update `/server` API routes to prioritize xAI/Grok over OpenAI (modify existing API wrappers).
   - Per-claim analysis: Adapt `/server` logic (e.g., analysis/create) to process claims individually, outputting single refined files to `/docs`.
   - PDF output: Use existing pdf-parse or add jsPDF to generate refined claim PDFs.
   - Tabulate claims: Reuse data parsing logic to create original vs. revised claim tables (Markdown/HTML in `/docs`), highlighting +36.2% value for advertising.
   - Value reports: Generate from existing enhancement logic, emphasizing improvements.
   - List claims (₹451.47 Cr): Extract from database or files (e.g., Plant ₹193.83 Cr, Loss of Opportunity ₹78.61 Cr).
   - Additional claims: Pull from enhancement logs in `/server`.
   - Add drafting engine/AI assistants: Enhance existing `/api/analysis` endpoints with templates and specialized logic (Delay/Quantum Experts).

7. **Testing the Enhanced Repository**:
   - Run: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:5000).
   - Tests: `npm test` for unit tests; validate claim processing, PDFs, FIDIC/NHAI compliance.
   - Programmatic web testing: Use Selenium/Puppeteer for React frontend, pytest for server logic, testing edge cases.
   - Replit testing: Import to Replit, use AI blueprints for iterations.

8. **Performance and Efficiency Improvements**:
   - Optimize code: Refactor redundant loops in `/server`, use efficient data structures.
   - Cache: Implement memoization or Redis (Replit-compatible) for API calls.
   - Load time: Lazy-load assets in `/client`, use CDN for static files.
   - Scalability: Leverage Replit’s Google Cloud auto-scaling.
